# Explore Restful Booker

Note: This is a homework exercise I would give to mid and senior level software testers applying to my open job positions. 

## Overview

Testing is more than finding bugs. It’s about exploring the knowns, the tacit & explicit and the unknowns in order to identify possible failures in an application. You need to report on what you found in order for someone to take action on it.


I’d like to get an idea of how you explore an application and identify risks (possible failures) and the kinds of things you look for when you test.

## Your mission

Explore the Restful Booker Platform using Chrome to discover possible ways it could fail.

Details
- Spend one to two hours exploring the application. No more than 2 hours, set a timer if needed.
- Take notes and organize them in any way that makes sense to you. Be as detailed or as high level as you want.
- Feel free to make any outlines, matrices, etc that help you.
- The Restful Booker Platform can be found at https://automationintesting.online

## Send Me
Report back to me with what you find via email. It should include:


1. A copy of your notes and any other documentation you created to help you test.
2. A paragraph or two within that email summarizing what your testing found, what bugs you saw, did anything stop you from testing and then answer this question: if you had more time would you continue with this mission or change it?


### Tips

- I will probably ask you questions about your notes so be sure they make sense to you.
